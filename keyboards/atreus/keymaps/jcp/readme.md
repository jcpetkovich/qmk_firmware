JCP's Atreus Key Map
====================

This is a port of my tmk layout to qmk. It's a collection of layers mapped to
infrequently typed letters that lets me type any key or key combination with
relative ease.

The layout was based loosely on jeremy's layout for the atreus in this same
repository.
